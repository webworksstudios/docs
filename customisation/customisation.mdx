## Branding
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Colours">
        All companies have a main colour, and several other brand colours that they use throughout their website and design elements. You can too with WebWorks.
        <Info>For all of our websites, we use the HEX code format for colours. Essentially, every colour has it's own code. E.g. #eab676, #5B1794.</Info>
        To get custom colours on your website, you'll have to send us these codes.
        Got a logo, but don't know what the codes for the colours are? Leave it to us.
        <Tip>We suggest using https://imagecolorpicker.com/ to get your HEX codes</Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Logos">
    Every company has a logo, and this is something that becomes recognisable across branding schemes. Think Nike's swoosh, and Apple's bitten apple. Unique, and you instantly know the company. You can get one too with WebWorks/
