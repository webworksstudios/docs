## Branding
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Colours">
    All companies have a main colour, and several other brand colours that they use throughout their website and design elements. You can too with WebWorks.
    <Info>For all of our websites, we use the HEX code format for colours. Essentially, every colour has it's own code. E.g. #eab676, #5B1794.</Info>
    To get custom colours on your website, you'll have to send us these codes.

    Got a logo, but don't know what the codes for the colours are? Leave it to us. 
    <Tip>We suggest using https://imagecolorpicker.com/ to get your HEX codes</Tip>

## Domain
<Note>What is a domain? e.g. https://google.com. It's what you type into a browser to get to your company's page.</Note>
